  "description":  "These packages provide the OpenJDK 6 Java Runtime Environment and the OpenJDK 6 Java Software Development Kit. An input validation flaw was discovered in the font layout engine in the 2D component. A specially crafted font file could trigger a Java Virtual Machine memory corruption when processed. An untrusted Java application or applet could possibly use this flaw to bypass Java sandbox restrictions. (CVE-2013-5907) Multiple improper permission check issues were discovered in the CORBA and JNDI components in OpenJDK. An untrusted Java application or applet could use these flaws to bypass Java sandbox restrictions. (CVE-2014-0428, CVE-2014-0422) Multiple improper permission check issues were discovered in the Serviceability, Security, CORBA, JAAS, JAXP, and Networking components in OpenJDK. An untrusted Java application or applet could use these flaws to bypass certain Java sandbox restrictions. (CVE-2014-0373, CVE-2013-5878, CVE-2013-5910, CVE-2013-5896, CVE-2013-5884, CVE-2014-0416, CVE-2014-0376, CVE-2014-0368) It was discovered that the Beans component did not restrict processing of XML external entities. This flaw could cause a Java application using Beans to leak sensitive information, or affect application availability. (CVE-2014-0423) It was discovered that the JSSE component could leak timing information during the TLS/SSL handshake. This could possibly lead to a disclosure of information about the used encryption keys.
