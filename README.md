### SW360 Portal

A software component catalogue application.

SW360 is a Backend server with a REST API to maintain your projects / products and the software components within.

It can manage SPDX files for maintaining the license conditions and maintain
license information.

### Introduction

It is comprised of one frontend (portal) part, backend (services) part and additionally a REST API:

* Backend: Tomcat-based thrift services for being called by different applications.
* Database: we store software components and metadata about them in CouchDB.
* Rest: this REST API provides access to project resources for external integration.

The reference platform is the Ubuntu server 22.04 (which is an LTS version).

### Project structure

This is a multi module maven file. please consider that we have the following modules:

* backend: For the thrift based services.
* libraries: For general stuff that is reused among the above, for example, couchdb access.
* scripts: Auxiliary scripts to help build, deploy and config system
* rest: For the REST API which contains an authorization and resource server.

### Issues

If you run in any issues with documentation or software, please be kind and report to our
[Github issues area](https://github.com/eclipse/sw360/issues).

### Deployment

Is recommended using the docker based setup,
[described here](https://github.com/eclipse/sw360/blob/main/README_DOCKER.md).

If you intend to install in a bare metal machine or use in your own virtualizaed system, [bare metal instructions are provided here](https://www.eclipse.org/sw360/docs/deployment/baremetal/deploy-natively/).

### Development

If you intend to develop over SW360, few steps are needed as equal you need have base
requirements

* Base build requirements
  * Java 11
  * Maven 3.8.7
  * pre-commit
  * thrift 0.16.0 runtime
  * Python environment ( to [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) ) - SW360 use Eclipse formatting rules
  through [Spotless maven plugin](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/tree/main/plugin-maven)

If you can't install thrift 0.16 runtime, you will need the following requirements:

* C++ dev environment
* cmake
Then run the current build script:

```bash
./scripts/install-thrift.sh
```

#### Local Building

**Step 1**: Prepare source code

```bash
git clone https://github.com/eclipse-sw360/sw360.git
cd sw360
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

**Step 2**: Build the code

```bash
mvn package -P deploy \
    -Dhelp-docs=false \
    -DskipTests \
    -Djars.deploy.dir=deploy \
    -Drest.deploy.dir=webapps \
    -Dbackend.deploy.dir=webapps
```

If you want run the the tests, we need start a local couchdb server and Docker is required:
