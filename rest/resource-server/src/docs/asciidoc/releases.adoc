With a `DELETE` request one or multiple attachments can be deleted from a release.

attachment IDs.

Note that attachments can only be deleted if they are not used by a project.
Requests that cannot delete any of the attachments specified fail with response
status 500.

===== Example request
include::{snippets}/should_document_delete_release_attachment/curl-request.adoc[]

===== Example response
include::{snippets}/should_document_delete_release_attachment/http-response.adoc[]

The response contains the updated release. Here the set of attachments is especially
relevant. If multiple attachments were to be deleted, but the deletion failed for
some of them, those can still be found in the set. So callers should inspect
the set of attachments in the result to find out whether all delete operations
have been successful.
