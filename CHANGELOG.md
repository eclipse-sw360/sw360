## sw360-18.1.0-M1
This tag includes important corrections and fixes following the 18.0 pre-release. It is also the final tag with Liferay, as SW360 will use the SW360-frontend project (https://github.com/eclipse-sw360/sw360-frontend) starting from the next release.

### Migrations

For existing installations, a data migration is required with PR 1963. Please go to the readme file in scripts/migrations to see more information:

https://github.com/eclipse/sw360/blob/master/scripts/migrations/README.md

Note: For running the migrations scripts, you will need python and the couchdb package. Please note that you will need to change manually in the python file: the DRYRUN variable and the couchdb URL (if that is not on localhost or requires password or both).

## sw360-18.0.0-M1
This tag covers many corrections/bug after the 17.0 release and multiple new endpoints to support sw360 UI project.

### Migrations

For existing installations, a data migration is required with PR 1963. Please go to the readme file in scripts/migrations to see more information:

https://github.com/eclipse/sw360/blob/master/scripts/migrations/README.md

For running the migrations scripts, you will need python and the couchdb package. Please note that you will need to change manually in the python file: the DRYRUN variable and the couchdb URL (if that is not on localhost or requires password or both).

## sw360-13.3.0-M1

This tag is applied to have the migration from cloudant to ektorp in one single step. Ektorp is a Java library which provides an object oriented interface to the (REST-based) access to couchdb. It has been used in sw360 from day 1. Now we concluded to replace ektorp: it does not support paging; having our server growing larger and lager and serving more and more users, receiving results sets from a couchdb view without paging is a pain. And it did not look like it will be supported, because the ektorp project looks calm now (last commit to master in 2017). Among the available options for replacing ektorp, we choose the java-client from the open source project cloudant (version 2.19.1, see https://github.com/cloudant/java-cloudant). It supports paging and offers potentially other interesting features (caching, compatibility with MongoDB, etc.).

### Migrations

For this version, no database migration is necessary.

### Infrastructure

* `0e22d55e` feat(components-pagination): paginated view response for components
* `fd95a2cf` feat(cloudant): Migrating from ektorp to cloudant java client

## sw360-13.2.0-M1

The reason for this tag is to have the last release before the ektorp framework to the new cloudant framework for access to the couchdb. This upcoming change will touch a large number of places in the code and thus a last release before this larger change will be merged.

As per notable feature there is the new UI in the admin area to issue the OAuth client credentials for the OAuth legacy workflow for the REST API. Another feature is the storing of all attachments (at upload) also to a configurable location in the file system. This helps anti virus software to scan these instead of requesting them from the couchdb. Note that files are stored at the configured path with `user_mail/document_id` folder structure to quickly track down origin of viruses and malware.

This milestone tag also chovers changes to the build infrastructure on the eclipse servers to prepare future releases.

## sw360-13.1.0-M1

This time: client libraries. This release among other things brings the client libraries taken over from the sw360antenna project and moved them into the sw360 code base. The client libraries enable Java applications to communicate with a sw360 server via REST calls. Other notable contributions include:

* Support for CouchDB 3.x
* Massive speedup of SPDX import by switching to streaming based parsing for license information for large files
* Single container setup (see `Dockerfile` in project root) for super easy deployment of sw360
* More UI improvement on sorting and filtering in list views
* Supporting multiple templates for the project clearing reports
* REST: Manage used attachments for license info generation and better querying of vulnerabilities

### Migrations

For this version, no database migration is necessary.

## sw360-13.0.0-M1

We tagged this release, because there are persons testing the current master and not seeing the migration script on the database required. The migration on the database came in because of changes on the obligations. After the major work on the obligations data model in the previous release, more work on the UI made a migration script necessary (number `042`). Please note that per our versioning convention, the database migration script makes the tag `13.0` not `12.1`.

### Migrations

For existing installations, a data migration is required. Please go to the readme file in `scripts/migrations` to see more information:

https://github.com/eclipse/sw360/blob/master/scripts/migrations/README.md

For running the migrations scripts, you will need python and the couchdb package. Please note that you will need to change manually in the python file: the `DRYRUN` variable and the couchdb URL (if that is not on localhost or requires password or both).

## sw360-12.0.0-M1

This release something special because it brings a lot, really a lot of changes in the database model, more specifically it is a refactoring of the licenses and obligation objects. Following corrections:

* Risks are dropped and migrated to obligations
* Term "todo" is eliminated and we aim at consistently use "obligation"

Then there are two new dimensions of obligations, first obligation level

* Organisation obligations: obligations that apply for all projects of the sw360 instance.
* Project obligations: obligations that apply for a specific project, for example, obligations need to be applied to software which is delivered on a device without display.
* Component obligations: obligations that apply to a release to be more precise, for example IP issues coming when using a particular release.
* License obligations: obligations which come from using software under a license.

Second, the obligations have types:

* Permissions
* Restrictions
* Obligations (finally)
* Risks (for example patent litigation clauses)
* Exceptions (for example classpath exception with GPL)

So that involves a lot of changes to the data model, and resulting a lot of migrations. We apologize in advance for the 18 migrations scripts to execute. But it will be easier to have individual migration scripts for particular changes instead of having a large one. Please refer to scripts/migrations/README.md for further details. Please note that in general, all scripts have a `DRYRUN` variable which is set to `True` by default and needs to be set to `False` to apply actually changes to the database.

Besides, this release has also some other changes, including:

* changing download URL into two attributes: binary download URL and source code download URL
* New REST Endpoint: Search!
* if you ant to write clients using REST: Pagination for some of the major listings!

### Migrations

For existing installations, a data migration is required. Please go to the readme file in `scripts/migrations` to see more information:

https://github.com/eclipse/sw360/blob/master/scripts/migrations/README.md

For running the migrations scripts, you will need python and the couchdb package. Please note that you will need to change manually in the python file: the `DRYRUN` variable and the couchdb URL (if that is not on localhost or requires password or both).

Apart from the changes to the infrastructure, a number of nice new features are introduced, including:

* A Japanese language file for SW360
* Multiple values for external ids for the same keys
* A completely new health check service for better monitoring of an sw360 installation
* Improvements on project handling

## sw360-10.0.0-M1

Again, another data model change, new major version. Please see the script `018_remove_unwanted_field_from_clearing_request.py` in the directory `scripts/migrations` to change the data model accordingly. The script is necessary for existing clearing request records; not executing the script will lead to malfunction of the sw360 application.

The update improves also runtime stability, because the escaping when displaying quotes has been improved: previously, special characters such as quotes have compromised the rendering of the page. Now, the content is rendered in a correct way.

Further improvements include:

* The ability to split releases from a component and assign this release to another component. This is the opposite case of merging components. On one hand it can undo mistaken component merges. On the other hand, user input, creating a release at the wrong component, can be corrected now.
* a new REST endpoint to request all details from a larger list in one REST call.
* a new REST endpoint to delete attachments from the REST API

More features include the ability to search for IDs when linking releases to projects or enhancements to the clearing request structures.

### Features

* `ef6170e1` feat(attachments): Evaluate check status before deletion.
* `ea6d31ad` feat(CRUI): Modifications in Clearing Request table in moderation tab.
* `90dbdb52` feat(attachments): Updated REST documentation.
* `220f991f` feat(attachments): ComponentController can now delete attachments.
* `5f504aef` feat(attachments): ReleaseController now supports deleting attachments.
* `2930cea5` feat(attachments): Added function to prepare deleting attachments.
* `8adb9147` feat(attachments): Implemented ThriftAttachmentServiceProvider.
* `daa3b3fb` feat(attachments): Introduced ThriftServiceProvider interface.
* `5783cc3b` feat(rest): Whitelisting project 'state' and 'phaseOutSince' field.
* `fc0c7e43` feat(ui/search): Search using rel. id and added link to the release in the search result.
* `2ec0e6d9` feat(REST): Added new allDetails Parameter to List Projects and List Releases API to fetch records with all details.
* `c0bf7132` feat(CRView): Clearing Request Comments enhancements.
* `8528ecfe` feat(SplitComponentUI): Move Component data like releases and attachments from Source Component to Target Component.

### Corrections

* `9c01170b` fix(escapeXML): Added missing escapeXML, to prevent js script execution and rendering break due to single or double quotes, Added missing escapeXml to merge-split Component, merge releases, license details view, list-details-edit view of project, component and release.
* `887533ba` fix(ProjectModeration): Fixed isWriteActionAllowedOnProject check for project update, Fixed incorrect value for Visibility in Edit Project view which has existing moderation request.

## sw360-9.0.0-M1

This release brings new features which also change the data model. Therefore, a major version step is justified. Major new features are:

* Support for custom field layout using the referring Liferay mechanism, fully transparent with the REST API using additional data fields
* Changelog for changed data for projects, components and releases
* Reordered sections in detail view
* A completely new view *Clearing Status* offering tree and list view

Besides bug fixes and features correct bugs so far. In order to fix a bug with the REST API, note that a migration script should be executed. It corrects a missing value for the status of the release which is also now automatically set when creating releases using the REST API (and not only in the Web user interface).

### Features

* `a2e65103` feat(PreferenceUI): Enabled Email notification for CR
* `49311164` feat(ProjectUI): Custom Field for Additional data in Project
* `1d3423cb` feat(ReadmeOss): Filter linked project from ReadmeOss based on selection
* `03000401` feat(ProjectUI): Unified view of Linked Project and Releases, Clearing status, Linked Release Hierarchy. View includes tree view and list view
* `89714248` feat: Support custom fields in additionalData group in Component and Release page
* `04b57fd1` feat(ChangeLogs): Revision history of Document

### Corrections

* `fb09ccee` fix(MigrationScript): Update releases with empty clearingState to default value - NEW_CLEARING
* `7bbd4235` fix(ClearingStatus): Tree View Release name getting truncated, Sort for Project mainline state and Clearing State in List View fixed , added search filter
* `4c7b0e72` fix(ClearingStatusView): Fixed uneven button height, console error related to createVulnerabilityTable, takes lot of time to load Clearing status list view for large dataset.
* `d1c3731f` fix(ChangelogBasicInfoUI): Applied generic style and reordered the metadatas for Basic Info.
* `78bff1ba` fix(UI): Clearing Request and Obligations fixes
* `79f5c9d4` fix(mergeComponent): Prevent multiple releases with same name and version for a component, which may occur during merge component
* `a4b44107` fix: Resolve conflict

* `e1aabab1` chore(deps-dev): Bump dom4j in /backend/src/src-licenseinfo

## sw360-8.2.0-M2

Although there are only few commits listed below for this release, the change from 8.1 to 8.2 is huge: sw360 supports now an UI which can be extended with different languages.

With the initial pull request, the English and Vietnamese languages is supported. More languages can be supported. For this, a translation file must be added. Please see `README_LANG.md` in the root level of the project directory for more details.

Many thanks to the colleagues at Toshiba for providing this big feature to the community.

### Features

* `8bd91be` feat: SW360 support multi-language update after review                                                  
* `994ad5c` feat: SW360 support multi-language                                                  

### Corrections

* `ae45236` fix(mergeUI): Provided fix for error message on merge component, release, vendor.

## sw360-8.1.0-M1

A version upgrade is justified, because of a number of new features have been integrated: FOSSology scans can be now triggered over the SW360 REST API. By this feature, an upload, for example from sw360antenna, could also trigger the FOSSology scan right away. It requires FOSSology being integrated with sw360.

Another new endpoint is the query for SHA1 values of a file to check if that attachment is actually already found at some release. With this endpoint, one would not need to search for release names and version before making a new entry, but just search for the source code attachment using its SHA1 value to check if an upload has been performed already.

A third new feature is the ability to agree on a clearing job for the software components of a project or product. A project owner can now send to a clearing expert a request to perform the clearing of software components right from SW360.

### Features

* `bb9f2ba` feat(REST): Trigger FOSSology process and check status
* `99e23dc` feat(ObligationUI): Added new status fields for Obligation
* `d025c4a` feat(rest): Attachement sha1 improvement
* `9a53e7b` feat(ProjectUI): Project Clearing Report

### Corrections

* `7bd1fd5` fix(UI/REST): Remove Trailing and leading whitespace for all fields in component, release and project
* `a2a4b16` fix(components): components listing limited to 200 entries both in UI and excel spreadseet
* `0de1db1` fix(vulerability): vulnerability view breaks at backslash in description

## sw360-8.0.1-M1

There is some small but very substantial bug in 8.0.0, which prevents the user from creating records in special conditions. Therefore, version 8.0.0 is deprecated and replaced by version 8.0.1.

### Corrections

* `c20fa46` fix(component/release): Add component and release error in UI

## sw360-8.0.0-M1

It is not really that we like to ignore minor releases, but release 8 is coming because:

* changes in the DB for external id handling, pls see migration script: `scripts/migrations/016_update_byExternalIds_component_view.py`
* changes in the Thrift API, allowing for SPDX BOM import pls see: `libraries/lib-datahandler/src/main/thrift/projects.thrift`

And as a larger, very important feature, there is the SPDX BOM import there in a first version, adding two modes:

* Import a project with linked releases from a SPDX BOM file
* Import a list of components and releases from a SPDX BOM file

Moreover a very important feature or fix has been provided for ensuring that malformed REST requests do not lead to failure in the application. Previously, providing wrong typed references (for example: linking releases to a project) was accepted by the application and can lead to malfunction then. The following list lists the detailed changes since 7.0.1:

### New Features

* `712ba79` feat(rest): validate the linked document ids in the payload before updating it in the DB
* `f90fcc4` feat(bomImport): implement SPDX BOM import for projects and releases
* `24999ce` feat(AddProjectReleaseRelation): add a project release relation for source code snippets
* `48de678` feat(REST): Patch Releases to Project

### Corrections

* `336534a` fix(REST): fixed search component by external id
* `bc28c54` fix(EditReleaseUI): Fixed missing functionality of button to delete release to release relation

* `4c0d5c9` fix(thrift): add should return ID on duplicate
* `1d65e70` fix(html): fix minor bugs and styling
* `b7a83d6` fix(ui): saving attachment usage issue for source code bundle and others

## sw360-7.0.1-M1

After tagging 7.0.0, we found two bugs to be corrected to provide a sound SW360. Therefore, here a new tagged version of sw360. Everyone should use 7.0.1-M1 instead of 7.0.0.

Adding rolling version since last tag will prepare automated tagging with incrementing patch level, retaining manual tagging for major and minor version only.

### Corrections

* `0dcd109` fix(ProjectUI: fixed blank / non-responsive screen on project
* `da677b5` fix(ui): fix issue #762

### Infrastructure

* `a37e24d` chore(readme): adding some more badges
* `f1a7c63`feat(chore): adding rolling versions based on commit count

## sw360-7.0.0-M1

The main reason for release version 7 is to have the license upgrade from EPL-1.0 to EPL-2.0. All contributing parties have submitted their consent by e-mail and on most cases also approved the referring pull request (https://github.com/eclipse/sw360/pull/756).

Another change which justifies a major version jump is the required view update in the couchdb. Please see https://github.com/eclipse/sw360/blob/master/scripts/migrations/README.md for more information when migrating from an older version. The view update allows users to configure the `My Projects` portlet.

### New Features

* `9b92795` feat(docs): relicensing from EPL-1.0 to EPL-2.0
* `66a4126` feat(Component/ReleaseUI): Added button to remove selected vendor for component and release

* `062c899` feat(HomePageUI): Listing of MyProjects is made configurable
* `9849cb0` feat(licenseinfo): Added filter to exclude releases based on selected relationship

### Corrections

* `2a52475` fix(ProjectUI): Show proper error msg ,when loading of project fails due to access or dependency not found
* `752bd78` fix(ProjectUI): fixed 'Project is temporarily unavailable' issue due to obligation feature
* `b32afd5` fix(ReleaseUI/REST): prevent cyclic link in release
* `0d2647d` fix(licenseinfo): White page while downloading license disclosure

### Infrastructure

* `d22aaaf` test: add script to start temporary couchdb with docker
* `df54014` chore(cleanup): drop unused and outdated code related to the codescoop integration

## sw360-6.0.0-M1

This release covers as the biggest change the new integration with the FOSSology REST API. It replaces the previous integration using an ssh login. It requires a migration of the couchdb database. More information about the scripts can be found in `scripts/migrations/README.md`.

Apart from changing the integration with FOSSology from ssh to the REST API, the entire data structure has been changed to be tool agnostic: A data structure for external tool requests replaces the info for the FOSSology upload. In future, albeit not supported today by the UI, also other tools could be integrated using the same data structure.

*Warning* Although the was much care for migrating existing data. It may happen with old datasets where source code attachments have been transferred to FOSSology using the ssh integration, the migration fails. For those datasets, the data must be changed manually. For example, just remove the status values.

*Warning* Migrations run per default in dry run mode, meaning that no changes are written to the database. After you have reviewed the changes (and checked that the scripts runs), you must change the `DRY_RUN` variable accordingly to `False`.

Two notable more features are provided by this release:

* Management for project obligations

## sw360-5.1.0-M1

This release contains a number of corrections after the Liferay Portal 7.2 CE GA1 based release has been rolled out. Therefore it contains mostly corrections for the UI. In addition to these, also the REST API endpoints were further improved. The report generation has been improved: Now, external Ids can be added to the generated documents.

Because it contains many corrections, every 5.0.0-M1 installation should be updated to this release.

## sw360-4.0.0-M1

Proudly announcing a new milestone release for SW360. We have many additions since the last release 3.3.0 in November 2018. The main reason why it turned into the 4.0.0, a major version change, was the change on the database model. According to our versioning guidelines, we have major release jumps when the DB changes. Please see below for details about how to deal with the change.

The release has the following new features:

* A first release of the project / product approval report, listing and maintaining obligations resulting from OSS use.
* Support for integration for single-sign-on and identity management server keycloak
* A lot of enhancements (new endpoints) to the REST API
* More management for using attachments (license information, source code)
* Starting to parse and show SPDX information in the Web UI
* Integration of Codescoop`s OSS library OSMAN.

### Comitters

#### Test, Documentation and Infrastructure

The most important part on the infrastructure part is the change of the thrift compile to version 0.11.0. This has an impact to all, because an update of the installed thrift compiler is required from the previous version for all machines where the sw360 projects needs to build. Note that also the ektrop lib has been updated as well as the webjars which include the Java script components for the Web UI.

* `7128acd` chore(common): Mail service sends notifications asynchronous

* `0632505` refactor(velocity): update to new version
* `6e8c349` refactor(webjars): update versions of webjars

#### Database Schema Updates

Because of changes in the couchdb schema you likely need to run a migration script. Please find more information here: `sw360/scripts/migrations/`, in summary, you will need to update in the database:

* Changes to the way how the selected licenses and resulting attachment usage information is stored leads to the need to execute `011_migrate_attachment_usages_license_info.py`.
* An identified for a todo was not used, but it was changed to title, so execute `012_migrate_todoid_to_title.py`.
