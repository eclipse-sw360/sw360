# Organization Mapping Configuration
# This file configures how organization names from identity providers (e.g., Keycloak, LDAP)
# are mapped to internal SW360 organization names.

# Enable custom organization name mapping (true/false)
# When disabled, organization names from identity provider are used as-is
enable.custom.mapping=false

# Enable prefix matching (true/false)
# When true: matches if organization name STARTS WITH the mapping key
# When false: matches only if organization name EXACTLY EQUALS the mapping key
match.prefix=false

# Organization Mappings
# Format:
#   mapping.<id>=<source organization name from identity provider>
#   mapping.<id>.target=<target SW360 organization name>
#
# Example mappings (uncomment and modify as needed):
#
# mapping.1=External Company A
# mapping.1.target=PARTNER_A
#
# mapping.2=External Company B Division
# mapping.2.target=PARTNER_B
#
# With prefix matching enabled (match.prefix=true):
# mapping.3=DEPT_
# mapping.3.target=DEPARTMENT
# This would map "DEPT_ENGINEERING", "DEPT_SALES", etc. all to "DEPARTMENT"
