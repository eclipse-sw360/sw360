# Organization Mapping Configuration for SW360 Keycloak Integration
#
# This file allows you to map organization/department names from your identity provider
# (e.g., Keycloak, LDAP) to internal SW360 organization names.
#
# SPDX-License-Identifier: EPL-2.0

# Enable or disable custom organization mapping
# If false, organization names will be used as-is from the identity provider
enable.custom.mapping=false

# Match prefix mode
# If true: Matches if the organization name STARTS WITH the mapping key
# If false: Requires exact match of the organization name
# Example with true: "Department-Engineering" matches "Department-" -> "ENG"
# Example with false: Only "Department-Engineering" exactly matches
match.prefix=false

# ==================================================================================
# Organization Mappings
# ==================================================================================
# Define mappings using the pattern:
#   mapping.N=<source-organization-name>
#   mapping.N.target=<target-sw360-organization-name>
#
# Where N is a unique number for each mapping
#
# Examples:
#
# Example 1: Map a specific department name
# mapping.1=Engineering Department
# mapping.1.target=ENGINEERING
#
# Example 2: Map company divisions
# mapping.2=Company Division A
# mapping.2.target=DIV_A
#
# Example 3: Prefix matching (when match.prefix=true)
# mapping.3=Department-
# mapping.3.target=DEPT
# This will map "Department-Engineering" -> "DEPT", "Department-Marketing" -> "DEPT", etc.
#
# Example 4: Multiple character mappings
# mapping.4=Research & Development
# mapping.4.target=RND
#
# ==================================================================================

# Add your custom mappings below:

# mapping.1=YOUR_SOURCE_ORG_NAME
# mapping.1.target=YOUR_TARGET_ORG_NAME

# mapping.2=ANOTHER_SOURCE_ORG
# mapping.2.target=ANOTHER_TARGET

# Organization Mapping Configuration
# This file configures how organization names from identity providers (e.g., Keycloak, LDAP)
# are mapped to internal SW360 organization names.

# Enable custom organization name mapping (true/false)
# When disabled, organization names from identity provider are used as-is
enable.custom.mapping=false

# Enable prefix matching (true/false)
# When true: matches if organization name STARTS WITH the mapping key
# When false: matches only if organization name EXACTLY EQUALS the mapping key
match.prefix=false

# Organization Mappings
# Format:
#   mapping.<id>=<source organization name from identity provider>
#   mapping.<id>.target=<target SW360 organization name>
#
# Example mappings (uncomment and modify as needed):
#
# mapping.1=External Company A
# mapping.1.target=PARTNER_A
#
# mapping.2=External Company B Division
# mapping.2.target=PARTNER_B
#
# With prefix matching enabled (match.prefix=true):
# mapping.3=DEPT_
# mapping.3.target=DEPARTMENT
# This would map "DEPT_ENGINEERING", "DEPT_SALES", etc. all to "DEPARTMENT"
